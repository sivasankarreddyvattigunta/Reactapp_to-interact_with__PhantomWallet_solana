# Interacting with Phantom Wallet - Module 2 Assessment

This React application allows users to interact with the Phantom wallet on the Solana blockchain. Users can create a new Solana account, connect to the Phantom wallet, disconnect from the wallet, and transfer SOL (Solana's native cryptocurrency) to the connected Phantom wallet.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have the following:

- Node.js installed on your system.
- Phantom Wallet extension installed in your web browser. If not, you can install it from [Phantom's official website](https://phantom.app/).

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd <project-directory>
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

1. Start the React development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. Follow the on-screen instructions within the application to create a new Solana account, connect to the Phantom wallet, disconnect from the wallet, and transfer SOL.

## Important Notes

- Ensure that your Phantom Wallet extension is active and properly set up in your browser.
- Make sure you have a stable internet connection while interacting with the Solana blockchain.
- Be cautious while performing transactions, as they are irreversible.
